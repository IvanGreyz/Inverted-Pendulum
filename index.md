# **Inverted Pendulum**

---

This is a project from class Introduction to Modern control in Ho Chi Minh University - University of Technology.

![Cart Pole]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/InvertedPendulum.png)

The cart has weight $M$. The pole has weight $m$ and rod's length $l$. The gravity acceleration is $g$ 

Cart's position is denoted by $\vec{x}$. Pole's position is denoted by $\vec{x}_p$, $\vec{y}_p$. The angle from the vertical line to pole's rod is denoted as $\theta$

For simulation, parameters  are numerically assigned:
